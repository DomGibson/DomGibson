    Who Am I?

<p align="center">
Hello, My name is Dom, Short for Dominik. I am 23 Years of age at the moment. I have studied a few topics regarding web, development in general and also sciences in computing. This leads into what funky content I can come up with alongside an AI copilot.</p>

<p align="center">
I started my adventure when I was introduced to computing at school. We had a range of topics to choose and I chose IT and Computer Science. However, I was fairly unlucky with my grades in Computing but managed to get a decent grade in IT. I have always wanted to venture out and learn code but never could wrap my head around it. It gave me ideas!</p>

<p align="center">
After passing college, I was successful into getting a place in University. I had no intention of getting a degree or even wanted to get stuck with all the debt. My inital thoughts were to look into a better IT course. I already qualified for a University level course so they signed me up for it.

University was challenging but also opened a lot... I mean a lot of doors. We were learning Code, Web Design, Sciences, Logic, Cyber Security. The list can go further. But I gained a lot of knowledge and it has kept me in the industry! Unfortunately I did not proceed with the course after a while, I was granted an opportunity that I could
